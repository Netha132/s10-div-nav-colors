        Dwarka has the Dwarkadhish Temple dedicated to Krishna, which is one of
        four sacred Hindu pilgrimage sites called the Chardham founded by Adi
        Shankaracharya at the four corners of the country. The Dwarkadhish
        Temple was established as a monastic center and forms part of the Dwarka
        temple complex.Dwarka is also one of the seven most ancient religious
        cities (Sapta Puri) in India. Dwarka is part of the "Krishna pilgrimage
        circuit" which includes Vrindavan, Mathura, Barsana, Gokul, Govardhan,
        Kurukshetra and Puri. It is one of 12 heritage cities across the country
        selected under the Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana
        (HRIDAY) scheme of the Government of India to develop civic
        infrastructure. Dwarka is considered as the first capital of Gujarat.[2]
        The name literally means gateway.[5] Dwarka has also been referred to
        throughout its history as "Mokshapuri", "Dwarkamati", and
        "Dwarkavati".[6] It is mentioned in the ancient epic period of the
        Mahabharata.[5] According to legend, Krishna settled here after he
        defeated and killed his uncle Kamsa at Mathura.[7] This mythological
        account of Krishna's migration to Dwarka from Mathura is closely
        associated with the culture of Gujarat.[8] Krishna is also said to have
        reclaimed 12 yojanas or 96 square kilometres (37 sq mi) of land from the
        sea to create Dwarka.[9] Archaeological findings suggest the original
        temple Dwarkadhish Temple dedicated to Krishna was built in 200 BCE at
        the earliest.[10][11][12] The temple was rebuilt and enlarged in the
        15th–16th century.[13][14] The temple is also the location of Dwaraka
        maţha, also called Sharada Matha/Peeth and "western peeth",[15][note 1]
        one of the four peeths (Sanskrit: "religious center") established by Adi
        Shankaracharya. As an important pilgrimage centre for Hindus, Dwarka has
        several notable temples, including Rukmini Devi Temple, Gomti Ghat, and
        Bet Dwarka. There is also a lighthouse at the land end point of Dwarka.
